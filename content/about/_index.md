## I am Yours

> I am a flower quickly fading\
Here today and gone tomorrow\
A wave tossed in the ocean\
A vapor in the wind

My name is Matthew Aaron Rodriguez.

### I believe in Jesus.

#### Christ is my identity.  I want to see the face of God.

There's a lot behind that: here's a [quick taste](https://cabosante.com/posts/my-5-minute-story/).

By trade, I am a web developer.  I studies Applied Physics at the University of Michigan (go blue!).  I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Delaware.  I suppose I have an affinity for Blue & Gold.
