Dear Hiring Manager,

Please accept this letter and accompanying C.V. as per *JOB POSITION*.  I consider the design and development of curious and exciting software problems my next endeavor.  Ever since a lad I have been drawn to solving puzzles — markedly exhibited by my exceptional ability to fit smaller pieces into a larger, often enigmatic final picture.  I am only being slightly facetious; my first grade teacher was so impressed with my ability to solve a select Tangram that the principle was brought in to compliment my school record setting time. (Or perhaps they brought her in to discuss the potential prodigy on their hands and see if they had any stake in the development, only to be disappointed by a slightly above average first grader who may or may not have started the Tangram earlier than the teacher expected — no matter, I am proud of the achievement and prefer the original memory to any hindsight bias.)

Regardless of objective reality, I did and still do enjoy problem solving.  My undergraduate stint with Electrical Engineering momentary curbed this inherent desire, smoothly transitioning into my short graduate tangle with Applied Physics.  As I, and many of us, I imagine, have discovered along the path of trying to solve the mysteries of the Universe and everything outside and in between: the old adage “the more you learn the less you know” is strikingly accurate.  As we learn and discover, the limitless potential grows and the desire for all knowledge is left to do just that: desire.

Thankfully, software development helps quench the thirsty mind.  My recent experience with a hyper start-up tech company taught me invaluable lessons and tools for software design and development, and I seek the opportunity to push this knowledge further.  Accordingly, I believe that my past experience has helped me develop skills tailored to fit *JOB POSITION*.  Characteristic of *COMPANY NAME* is the union of web technology and *COMPANY TYPE*, and I look forward to the potential growth and camaraderie in such an environment.

I hope to be considered for the job, and would welcome the opportunity to meet and further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time.


Respectfully yours,\
Matthew Rodriguez
