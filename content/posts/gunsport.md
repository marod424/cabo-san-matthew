> In the tradition of the great arcade titles, Gunsport is a game about precise action and timing. The aim of the game is to get the ball into the opponent's goal, making the best use of your limited shots. The only way to get the ball into the goal is by shooting it there, using of your team's unique special weapons and each stage's gimmicks or game-changing rulesets. Gunsport is familiar but different - this is Future Millennium Sporting Action!

<h1 style="text-align: center">6.6 / 10</h1>

I love gaming, and yet I dislike going to the arcade. Prone to deception, I reject spending quarters for an unknown duration of gameplay, particularly when under the pressure of an obtrusively flashing countdown.

This unique arcade-style game doesn't change my bias, despite trying it within the comfort of my own battle station. Ironically, I would prefer it standing -- with a joystick and some red buttons.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after spending four hours of flashy gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 6.6 / 10

*Gunsport* is a traditionally designed arcade game with simple controls, showy characters, fun levels, hype music, and a gimmicky overall progression. Loosely following the rules of volleyball, the gameplay trivially includes aiming and shooting a "ball", with the optional inclusion of moving and jumping. At its best in a physical arcade, *Gunsport* is an easy game that some arcade fanatics may enjoy.

### Gameplay: 5.0 / 10
Should be confined to a machine that looks like an ATM and has a few joysticks and big red buttons. 
<br>
<br>

#### Controls 7.5 / 10
Fine. Aiming with a mouse can be a bit janky. Made for a joystick, I digress...

#### Difficulty: 2.5 / 10
Super easy. I could almost win every match without paying attention. Well, except for the final match of each circuit, which is noticeably difficult. Also I beat the whole game and unlocked all the achievements in less than four hours.

#### Progression: 5.0 / 10
The difficulty progression is tragic. Also this is an arcade game, there isn't much to it. Each team can unlock a new skin when you complete their circuit.

***

### Story: 7.6 / 10
There is some humor and the characters aren't complete shells. 
<br>
<br>

#### Characters: 7.7 / 10
The characters are my favorite part of the whole experience. They have relatively interesting backstories (for an arcade game).

#### Setting: 7.4 / 10
Each team comes from a different country and has their own arena with its unique flair. It works.

#### Progression: 7.6 / 10
Story progression for each team, as they complete their circuit, is pretty much the only progression in the game.

***

### Production: 7.3 / 10
Meh, I guess it's an arcade game.
<br>
<br>

#### Music 7.4 / 10
Some of it is actually quite hype. Overbearing at moments.
 
#### Art 7.6 / 10
The physique and mustache on the Cambodian keeper is alluring.

#### Graphics 7.0 / 10
Arcade graphics. Some gun animations look nice.
