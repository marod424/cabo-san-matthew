> Face your fears in GYLT, a haunting tale about bullying and childhood nightmares, as you help Sally navigate a creepy world to rescue her missing cousin Emily.

<h1 style="text-align: center">9.3 / 10</h1>

Reflect back to grade school -- do you remember any bullying? If not, then take a good long look in the mirror and recall carefully; you may have hurt others with your words or actions -- you may have been a monster.

This piercing story, through the imagination of a child, illustrates the evil of bullying with powerful metaphor. To those I may have hurt in my careless, selfish, and insecure moments -- I am sorry.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after consuming four hours of poignant gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 9.3 / 10

*GYLT* is an expertly written journey of introspection that unfolds through the experience of a brave and shrewd young girl. Composed of acute moments, imagined with gripping imagery, and set within a chillingly familiar atmosphere, the story plays out with excellent progression as our protagonist discovers the secrets of her town, her family, and herself. Engrossing from the first moment, *GYLT* successfully depicts the darkness of bullying in this probing tale.

### Gameplay: 9.2 / 10
A well-designed and clever means to tell the story.
<br>
<br>

#### Controls 8.6 / 10
Pretty smooth and well-thought-out. One complaint: why is there no menu to see the controls or adjust in game settings? Did I somehow miss this?

#### Difficulty: 9.3 / 10
Maybe, just maybe, a little too easy. But it doesn't get in the way of the story which is the right idea.

#### Progression: 9.8 / 10
The game mechanics unfold in parallel to the story, progressing nicely in difficulty and scope.

### Production: 8.7 / 10
Expert in storytelling.
<br>
<br>

#### Music 8.0 / 10
Maybe the biggest miss out of the whole production, and that's only because I don't remember it -- did I just miss it?

#### Art 8.8 / 10
Nice artwork throughout; elegantly captures the imagery of the story.

#### Graphics 9.1 / 10
For the most part they look nice and the animations are clean. However the graphics degrade in the shadows and in the darkness. I was hoping to fiddle with some settings (i.e. brightness) but no luck in finding a menu for that.

**Recommend?**  
At the very least for the story.   

**Replay?**  
I WILL finish this game, God willing.

**Joy?**  
The story evokes sorrow through the long night, but I'm anticipating joy in the morning!
