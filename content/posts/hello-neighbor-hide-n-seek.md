<h1 style="text-align: center">7.0 / 10</h1>

What's behind door number two? Well, since I already revealed that there is a goat behind the first (no, not the **G**reatest **O**f **A**ll **T**ime, more of the fainting variety), do you want to switch games and try the third? 

This curious prequel, following in the footsteps of the previous work, also appears to contain a goat. I guess you should have brushed up on the [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) and gone with door number three, *Secret Neighbor*.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after enduring four hours of frustrating gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 7.0 / 10

*Hello Neighbor: Hide and Seek* is an inspired game that captures the germ of excellence but lacks execution. As a prequel to *Hello Neighbor*, it reveals much of the backstory behind the original, humanizing the creepy neighbor through the perspective of his children, while simultaneously preserving the original gameplay -- and it's a shame.  In disappointing fashion, *Hello Neighbor: Hide and Seek* continues the unfortunate pattern of an imaginatively great idea poorly delivered.

### Gameplay: 7.1 / 10
Exactly like that of the original. And with no improvement, we grade harder the second time through.
<br>
<br>

#### Controls 5.7 / 10
Still a failure.

#### Difficulty: 7.2 / 10
The greatest difficulty while playing this game is in maintaining a positive attitude.

#### Progression: 8.4 / 10
Like in the previous, it's there.

***

### Story: 7.9 / 10
The best part about this game. Compelling as it builds off of the first.
<br>
<br>

#### Characters: 7.5 / 10
Humanizing the original antagonist through the eyes of his children.

#### Setting: 7.7/ 10
Creative design that brings a child-like imagination to life within the setting of the original home.

#### Progression: 8.5 / 10
It builds on the first. Well done.

***

### Production: 6.1 / 10
Unfinished, again. Docking points for not improving.
<br>
<br>

#### Music 4.5 / 10
I intentionally listened for this, and while there was some music, it quickly fades into nothing.

#### Art 7.0 / 10
Same as before.

#### Graphics 6.9 / 10
Same same.

**Recommend?**  
Nope.

**Replay?**  
Thanks to it being a prequel, I kind of just did.

**Joy?**  
Yes, if pain brings you joy.
