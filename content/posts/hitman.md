<h1 style="text-align: center">9.9 / 10</h1>

Ah yes, the unassuming self-sacrifice of the secret agent life. Oh, to be so skillfully trained, handsomely adorned, financially blessed, and yet not able to tell anyone about your service -- to live the untold story of hidden glory.

This silently achieving franchise uncovers that of the undercover. I am grateful, as now I can vicariously experience the humble role of a CIA-operative-field-agent-assassin from the comfort of my own couch, and in turn openly and confidently boast of my heroics.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after executing four hours of covert gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 9.9 / 10

*HITMAN* is a consistently successful franchise, built on titles filled with unique missions and stories that rival those of *James Bond: 007*. With a winning formula that sandwiches open-ended missions between beautiful cinematics, the gameplay unfolds as you step into the role of the undercover operative to fulfill contract objectives and execute targets. *HITMAN* is a tactical spy-thriller that, characteristic of its own, quietly and expertly delivers.

### Gameplay: 9.9 / 10
An absolute pleasure. Delicately balances strategy and skill; ultimately rewards grit and patience.

#### Controls 9.8 / 10
Quite lovely. The control to highlight object interactions, objectives, and targets is a wonderfully crafted design.

#### Difficulty: 9.9 / 10
Just about perfect. Sneaking around undetected sometimes feels a bit unrealistically easy, but difficulty settings can be adjusted.

#### Progression: 10 / 10
One target in the beach-mansion, two targets in the Miami race-track arena, three targets in the hidden Colombian drug-cartel controlled jungle outpost, and two targets plus one mysterious objective in the slums of Mumbai -- it's the progress I made, and although incomplete, the experience was perfect.

### Story: 9.9 / 10
It doesn't touch on difficult topics and release you into an everlasting soul-searching self-introspective reverie, and for that I am docking a tenth of a point.

<br>

#### Characters: 9.9 / 10
Good guys -- you want to be them. Bad guys -- the dark-side of you wants to be them, well, until you ASSASSINATE them!

#### Setting: 10 / 10
Perfect. Ranging all around the globe, the mission locations are intricate and cleverly designed. 

#### Progression: 9.9 / 10
Can and should be produced into a movie, as it unravels at just the right pace and with just the right amount of intrigue.

### Production: 9.8 / 10
Bravo! a Triple-A production.

#### Art 9.9 / 10
Lovely, precise, and beautiful.

#### Graphics 9.8 / 10
Demands a display that can show it off.
