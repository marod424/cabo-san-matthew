> Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious, light-hearted physics platformer set in a world of floating dreamscapes.

> Each dream level provides a new environment to navigate, from mansions, castles and Aztec adventures to snowy mountains, eerie nightscapes and industrial locations. Multiple routes through each level, and perfectly playful puzzles ensure exploration and ingenuity are rewarded.

> Should your Human fall from a rope, misjudge a platform or even get pushed off a cliff by a friend, never fear: they will simply fall back into the dream, ready to try again and again.

> Human: Fall Flat can be played solo or with up to 16 players online for even more laughter.

Alas, of what is all too familiar, the plight of humanity. Why must we live and hope and believe just to fail, to fall, and to consequently wear our wounds and bear our scars -- a reminder of our burdens and human imperfections?

This playfully optimistic game embraces that reality. However what it teaches, and what I've found, with the help of others, is that the persistence to always get back up is our God given way back towards progress and hope regained.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after entertaining four hours of delightful gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 9.2 / 10

*Human: Fall Flat* is a conceptually simple game triumphantly delivered. Seemingly built as a physics development playground to explore ragdoll mechanics, it exceeds expectations with its intuitive controls, adorable characters, cleverly designed levels, hilarious gameplay, and overall fun experience. *Human: Fall Flat* is much more than it appears, a testament towards excellence over expenditure, and a wonderful reminder to get back up and try again.

### Gameplay: 9.6 / 10
You would never expect to have so much fun jumping, climbing, and grabbing everything in sight. I suppose unless you still possess the heart of a child.

#### Controls 9.4 / 10
Simple and intuitive. One mistake, in my opinion, is the use of *bksp* over *esc* for the menu.

#### Difficulty: 9.6 / 10
A key contributor to the overall success of the gameplay, the difficulty throughout feels just right.

#### Progression: 9.7 / 10
Excellent puzzle progression with respect to both mentally solving and physically completing them. The transition from single to multiplayer also adds a level of complexity and growth.

***

### Story: 8.9 / 10
A bit surprisingly, the story subtly emerges from the silly design of the game, in a beautifully unspoken way.

<br>

#### Characters: 8.7 / 10
They are cute, floppy, and fairly customizable.

#### Setting: 9.0 / 10
From boats to castles, the level design is wonderful and simultaneously serves as a direct obstacle and charming backdrop.

#### Progression: 8.9 / 10
Slowly and consistently impresses upon the subconscious of the traveler.

***

### Production: 9.0 / 10
Simple compared to Triple-A titles, but not to be underestimated or dismissed.

<br>

#### Music 9.3 / 10
Quite lovely, when it plays during moments of in game progression. I just wish they played more of it.

#### Art 9.0 / 10
It does the trick, and belongs.

#### Graphics 8.7 / 10
Looks a bit like claymation, and it works.
