Are nightmares even quantifiable? No, not the collection of them in your lifetime -- that's more likely a measure of your age and a reflection of the conscious impressions you consume -- rather, what is the magnitude of an individual nightmare after a long and fearful night?

This mystically haunting story loosely measures out and serves small doses. Alas, the dosage does not seem to matter to me -- I suppose an extra load of laundry is in order.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after encountering four hours of eerie gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 9.5 / 10

*Little Nightmares* is a masterfully produced vision of a sinister tale. Powerfully told through the exploration and attempted escape from a haunting progression of monsters, the diminutive and mysterious protagonist, equipped solely with the light of a dependable flame, relies on the simple gifts of persistent movement and the opportunity that the space around provides. *Little Nightmares*, despite fantasizing that of the morbid and grotesque, delivers an unforgettable nightmare that, ironically, ends too soon.

### Gameplay: 9.1 / 10
A well-designed gaming experience from start to finish.
<br>
<br>

#### Controls 8.7 / 10
Mostly effective. Old clumsy-me found the *semicolon* key an odd choice for grabbing and interacting with objects.

#### Difficulty: 9.4 / 10
Just about right, with a slightly easy leaning. I would have loved a longer game that got a bit more difficult.

#### Progression: 9.3 / 10
Difficulty, character movements, and object interactions progress elegantly. It would have been nice to include gameplay tracking, for example counting the number of breakable dolls or lit lanterns.

### Story: 9.6 / 10
Vividly nightmarish and dreamlike in a manner reminiscent of the Japanese animated fantasy film *Spirited Away*.

<br>

#### Characters: 9.4 / 10
Among disturbingly grotesque and obtuse monsters, a touch of subtle backstory for our user controlled protagonist would have landed the highest marks.

#### Setting: 10 / 10
Perfect.

#### Progression: 9.5 / 10
A powerfully written ending that comes too soon.

***

### Production: 9.8 / 10
Take a bow.
<br>
<br>

#### Music 9.3 / 10
Fitting, and right on the mark, but takes a backseat to the visual imagery.

#### Art 10 / 10
Worth more than a thousand words; a pleasure for the eyes to behold.

#### Graphics 9.9 / 10
In union with the artwork -- stunning.

**Recommend?**  
If you can stomach the fear!  

**Replay?**  
Hmm, there is choice at the beginning to play as a different character. I wonder if they have the same nightmare?

**Joy?**  
In a strange, visceral, adrenalin infused way, particularly after escaping the grasp of a monster.
