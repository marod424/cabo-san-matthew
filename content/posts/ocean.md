> Ocean, of many rivers, O’ how you maintain.\
> Your surface, when shone upon, peels away.\
> You say to cloud, borrow and accumulate.\
> Once a wave, your face now moves and pours out like rain.

> Upon the mountaintop, of the filled and the rejoicing,\
> Your pouring out reigns in abundance.\
> The gravity of the incidence, compelled by its very nature,\
> Draws out to flow below.

> Call out to the valley, to the contrite heart and lowly spirit,\
> Lift your eyes to the mountaintop; be filled by an overflowing.\
> Flood your fields; give life and growth, refreshment and renewal.\
> Flow once again, into me -- Ocean.
