<h1 style="text-align: center">6.5 / 10</h1>

Oh, the gaming days of yore, of the simple games and the penny arcade. Times have changed, and while most of us indulge our past through memory and reminiscent banter, still others work to rebuild their fading moments.

This game is exactly that, a remake, a captured glimpse into that which once was. I hope the nostalgia brings joy to those who may have forgotten until reminded, who may have found what was once lost, because frankly it is lost on me.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after passing a few hours of obsolete gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 6.5 / 10

*Panzer Dragoon: Remake* is, as the title suggests, a remake of an original niche classic. It plays exactly like an arcade game -- with credits, countdowns, and secret codes for unlockable modes -- seemingly recreating an old game into a modern version with better graphics and portable controls. *Panzer Dragoon: Remake* surely does not disappoint for the niche arcade enthusiasts looking to rekindle a past spark, and for the rest of us... well I'll leave that up to you.

**Recommend?**  
Not unless you loved the original and are looking for a quick hit of nostalgia.

**Replay?**  
No.

**Joy?**  
Not really, but I'm not fond of arcade games so it was a fixed match from the onset.
