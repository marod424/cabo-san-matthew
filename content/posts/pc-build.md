# PC Build 2020

## CPU
Overall, Ryzen or Intel at each price bracket are extremely competitive with each other.

Pure multi-threaded applications such as video rendering greatly benefit from Ryzen, due to the number of cores and threads. Meanwhile, Intel focuses on higher per-core performance.

Single core performance is still king currently for gaming, assuming you got at least 4 cores.

Ryzen CPUs take a large hit in performance when the RAM is not overclocked. Thankfully, most RAM kits come with an overclocking profile, although you still need to manually configure the RAM profile in the BIOS.

## Storage
SSDs improve the load times in day-to-day usage. Loading Windows, Firefox, or Word, for example, are another order of magnitude faster. However, it has minimal impact on gaming performance apart from slightly decreasing the loading time.

## Video Card
*Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER*
> NVIDIA has a noticeably better video encoder, and is therefore a better option for streaming.

## OS

If you don't have a working Windows license, you can still run Windows 10 with the condition that you see an "Activate Windows" watermark and you are not allowed to personalize your computer. (e.g. changing the wallpaper)

If you need a single Linux distro for a recommendation, you can't go wrong with Pop!_OS. It has the popularity and support of Ubuntu, but the appearance and behavior similar to Windows, assuming that you are familiar to Windows.

For Windows, you can use Windows Media Creation Tool.

For Linux, you download the disc image (.iso) then write it to a USB using a tool such as Balena Etcher.

## Internet

**Q: What if I need wireless internet connectivity?**

 > By default, our builds do not come with wireless connectivity as most users generally use an Ethernet cable to get on the internet. If wireless is something you need in your build, we recommend adding a PCIe wireless card with at least 5GHz dual band connectivity such as these wireless cards. Keep in mind there are other options such as Powerline Ethernet, but we recommend you research not only specific units, but also if one will work with your residence's wiring.

> What sort of experience will this deck get you? CDPR doesn't say, other than to clarify that the targets are for 1080p low. Is that 1080p low quality at 60 fps or 30 fps, though? If we were to hazard a guess, it's closer to the former than the latter.
