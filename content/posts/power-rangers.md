> Generations of Power Rangers collide across the multiverseâ€™s 25 year history. Experience authentic, but reimagined Power Rangers gameplay. This easy to learn, but hard to master fighting game is designed to welcome players of all skill levels.

<h1 style="text-align: center">8.6 / 10</h1>

Were you sheltered in an overbearing protective bubble from the external powers of a fictional multiverse? It wasn't a childhood honor worth bragging about in the schoolyard, nor is it today -- forget I mentioned it.

This classically beloved franchise commemorates a quarter century of existence. Sure, I may know nothing of the characters or lore, but it's never too late to burst free from a bubble and step into the world of JASON LEE SCOTT (JLS).

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after mashing four hours of sweaty gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 8.6 / 10

*Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid*, celebrating the eponymous franchise, is an overall enjoyable fighting game. Cast within a multiverse of cross-generational characters, the familiar heroes, led by the fearless Red Ranger Jason Lee Scott, draw together to fight against evil with variegated attacks, accessible combos, and spectacular special moves. *Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid*, a familiar but original gaming experience, should please fighting game enthusiasts and Power Ranger aficionados alike.

### Gameplay: 8.9 / 10
Subjectively, I rank fighting games as low tier gameplay. I find the learning curve to master them a bit too steep, always defaulting into a button mashing battle of mayhem. This game does nicely, though, and it feels accessible and fun.

#### Controls 9.1 / 10
Well documented and easy enough to pick up, especially for a fighting game. The teammate assist and swap actions take a bit of an effort to get right.

#### Difficulty: 8.7 / 10
Through button mashing alone the story mode was fairly easy to beat, until it was not. Then it was too hard to beat. Online play has a nice ranked system that attempts to match you with opponents of a similar caliber. Tough to measure how well the matchmaking works -- I was a bit of a maverick on the sticks.

#### Progression: 9.0 / 10
Level up characters, learn some new moves, unlock skins. Nothing crazy here, just good ol' fashioned fighting game progression.

***

### Story: 8.4 / 10
A three act story, each composed of a handful of chapters, weaving cinematic character dialog and fighting gameplay.
<br>
<br>

#### Characters: 9.0 / 10
JLS, 10 / 10. There are other characters, and they are Power Ranger's and stuff, whatever / 10.

#### Setting: 8.2 / 10
It's a multiverse, how excitingly overwhelming. I wish the levels were more interactive, but I suppose that's more of a gameplay critique.

#### Progression: 8.1 / 10
Like a Saturday morning cartoon.

***

### Production: 8.6 / 10
Not just a free ride on the *Power Ranger's* past success, this game is actually quite polished and overall well-made.

#### Music 8.5 / 10
Hype fighting rock music that gets a bit repetitive but is exactly what one would expect.

#### Art 8.6 / 10
It's professional, and looks nice.

#### Graphics 8.7 / 10
Animations pop and the graphics do well.

**Recommend?**  
Yes, if you're a fan of Power Rangers or fighting games, and definitely if you're a fan of both.

**Replay?**  
Despite my general aversion to fighting games, I just may.

**Joy?**  
Climbing the online ranks as a JLS one-trick, how could I not!?
