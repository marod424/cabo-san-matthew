> Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is competitive tower defense and arcade action rolled up with ACE Team's quirky, Monty Python-esque humor into one giant, creative game for the ages.

<h1 style="text-align: center">6.7 / 10</h1>

*Does anyone here dislike history?* It was the question that my 10th grade history teacher posed to the room on our first day of class, and to which I promptly and eagerly raised my hand to in confirmation.

This quirky game uses history for its story line. Shame, really, I thought history may grow on me with age, rather it appears to be cementing me into its very fabric.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after recording a few hours of antiquated gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 6.7 / 10

*Rock of Ages 3* is a creative tower defense arcade style game, with a spin. The game tasks the player to construct a tower defense, and consequently, borrowing game mechanics from *Super Monkey Ball*, offers the player a chance to spring an attack by rolling a boulder at the opponent's encampment, ultimately imposing a race of destruction between the two contenders. *Rock of Ages 3* flips the script on tower defense style games, imagining something unique that, unfortunately, feels a bit like the fate of Sisyphus.

### Gameplay: 7.0 / 10
Good enough to kill some time.

<br>

#### Controls 7.7 / 10
Fine. I'll never understand the choice to use a different key over *esc* for pausing to a menu, in this case the *p* key.

#### Difficulty: 6.4 / 10
The tutorial stumped me longer than it should. Poor onboarding. Maybe the difficulty is balanced once the game is understood, but frankly I never bothered to get to that point.

#### Progression: 6.9 / 10
Appears to have a lot of challenges and different game modes, including online custom games. I think progression is a bait though, as the gameplay sort of blends into the same repetitive thing.

### Story: 6.9 / 10
It plays on history and is supposedly funny. Didn't do it for me.

<br>

#### Characters: 7.2 / 10
Historical figures or something of the sort; they drive the story.

#### Setting: 6.8 / 10
The levels feel similar, and seem to just depend on what you build with.

#### Progression: 6.6 / 10
I'd rather sit in history class.

### Production: 6.1 / 10
I'm clearly just missing something, or maybe I wasn't in a good mood, because this is the third game in the series but I can't fathom how or why.

#### Music 6.3 / 10
Started to annoy me. Maybe enjoyable if you find the game enjoyable.

#### Art 6.1 / 10
Not for me.

#### Graphics 5.8 / 10
