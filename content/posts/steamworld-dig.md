<h1 style="text-align: center">8.3 / 10</h1>

Oh, to recall high school AutoCAD class, a respite from the academic grind and an oasis for online flash games! I played countless games during those days -- many a welcome temporary distraction lost amongst a few unforgettable gems.

This playfully familiar indie game evokes such nostalgia. No, it was not a game I once played, but rather a descent into the cavernous mine of gaming memories, fittingly spelunking within the archives of leisurely recollections.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after surveying four hours of reminiscent gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 8.3 / 10

*SteamWorld Dig* is a fun indie game of familiar mechanics. Carried along by a fitting story of a steam powered robot digging for answers in a newly inherited mine, the gameplay feels of a simplified *Spelunky* or *Terraria*, built upon the objective of mining for progressively more valuable resources in exchange for items to aid a gradually complex and perilous descent. *SteamWorld Dig*, although lacking substantial depth, is a solid and enjoyable experience of casual gaming.

### Gameplay: 8.1 / 10
Engaging and fun, but with room for improvement.
<br>
<br>

#### Controls 7.4 / 10
Uses arrow keys over *w, a, s, d* keys for movement and doesn't use the mouse at all, resulting in unintuitive controls. 

#### Difficulty: 8.2 / 10
Fairly easy, and beatable in a sitting or two, but not entirely trivial.

#### Progression: 8.7 / 10
The gameplay is effectively built around item and difficulty progression, which does well. 

***

### Story: 8.6 / 10
It's a playful story of a steam-robot (steambot) inheriting a mining town, written to drive the gameplay.

<br>

#### Characters: 8.4 / 10
The steambots engage in cute dialog, build some character, and have a little back story to carry them along.

#### Setting: 8.6 / 10
The mine progresses in difficulty and complexity as you descend deeper, driving much of the gameplay as well as the story.

#### Progression: 8.7 / 10
The story progresses purely for the gameplay, and it wraps up in a familiar and predictable fashion, yet it works and is enjoyable.

***

### Production: 8.2 / 10
Indie production, through and through, with nothing too exceptional nor detrimental. It's an overall good effort to be built off of.

<br>

#### Music 8.2 / 10
It's there and it works, but it's not a bop and it doesn't slap.

#### Art 8.3 / 10
Yeah, looks right.

#### Graphics 8.1 / 10
Fine. Didn't wow me and didn't bother me.

**Recommend?**  
It's worth a play through.

**Replay?**  
Probably not, unless you count the [sequel](/posts/steamworld-dig-2).

**Joy?**  
I can dig it.
