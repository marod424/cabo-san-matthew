<h1 style="text-align: center">7.5 / 10</h1>

Sixty-four is the first whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. Sixty-four is also a superperfect number, which probably means something to mathematicians but sounds superfluous to the layman.

This classically inspired game is built for mathematicians and layman alike. As a layman, I am ready to battle as one amongst a pool of sixty-four contenders -- a royale of superperfect scale.

*<b>Disclaimer</b> &mdash; this review is a result of my biased first impression after bombing a few hours of explosive gameplay and should be taken lightly.*

## Overall: 7.5 / 10

*SUPER BOMBERMAN R ONLINE* is an online adaptation of a timeless classic. Extending the familiar game mechanics of the BOMBERMAN franchise, online play hosts a battle-royale like experience where sixty-four contenders, each as a customizable bomber of varying strengths and playstyles, battle by exploding blocks and each other for item upgrades and the chance to be the last bomber standing. *SUPER BOMBERMAN R ONLINE* is a worthy attempt that fails to engage and excite at a level characteristic of its classic form.

### Gameplay: 8.7 / 10
It's explosive! Yup, had to.
<br>
<br>
 
#### Controls 9.0 / 10
Solid. Default mappings are fine; I chose to remap the "special" attack key.

#### Difficulty: 8.5 / 10
Easy to learn. Depends almost entirely upon the competition, of which many were bots.

#### Progression: 8.7 / 10
Ranks, levels, challenges, and character customization. It's an ok touch but mostly feels like lipstick on a pig.

***

### Story: 6.3 / 10
What story?
<br>
<br>

#### Characters: 8.0 / 10
Well, there is a tiny bit of character backstory. The green bomber is the youngest sibling, apparently.

#### Setting: 6.0 / 10
The levels exist for the gameplay alone, and contribute nothing to story.

#### Progression: 5.0 / 10
None.

***

### Production: 7.5 / 10
Average.

<br>

#### Music 7.5 / 10
Middle C.

#### Art 7.5 / 10
Cute. Lines and shapes with color.

#### Graphics 7.5 / 10
Renders and does its job.

Maybe the classic mode.

**Joy?**    
In bursts.
