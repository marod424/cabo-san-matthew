## Would you Dooble me?

A question most often received with a question:

>Would you Dooble me? What does that mean?

I should expect this query. I've been sporting the unusual question on my chest for a good portion of the last decade.

It's an absolutely lovely t-shirt. One of quality and comfort. I regret not procuring more.

> Would you Dooble me?

I suppose it deserves an explanation. 

Well, the goal was to make *dooble* a household verb, like *tweet* or *Netflix and chill*. The Dooble founder believed that a new social media platform would require some tactful marketing and viral growth. Like most good ideas the concept driving Dooble was a simple one. Similar to Tinder, hopeful Dooble users swipe and match and *maybe* go on a date. But on Dooble, there was a twist – matched users each bring a friend on their date! Furthermore, the Dooble engine would then select the best venue for the Dooblers (nice) given their relative location.

Like a double date! Double... *Dooble*. They Dooble each other! Hmm, ya, never mind - it didn't take.

I began at Dooble back in early 2014, approximately a year after grad school.

A good friend was part of the small NYC based Dooble team and set up the connection. Dooble wasn't my idea, but I liked it well enough and thought it had potential. Plus I was tired of tutoring in my hometown while living in my parent's basement (a fact my younger brother loved to tease me about after my prodigal tenure in school).

I was technical enough, coming from an engineering and physics background, and coding runs in the bloodline. It was a nice match, and although I was young and inexperienced, it was well-balanced by my being underpaid.

NYC living was fun. I learned and experienced a lot, both in life and in web development.  It got my foot in the door. Dooble failed – I was let go, but it wasn't a personal failure. I believe the same can be said for each of my Dooble colleagues.

**God bless them.**
